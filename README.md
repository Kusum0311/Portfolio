# Portfolio
 Creating a personal portfolio with the basic skills in CSS and HTML. This is yet again, one of the most common projects on web development. In a personal portfolio, we get to show a wide range of samples and skills and add my resume. we can add an image at the top where we can introduce yourself; below that, we can add contact information.
